# Decision Tree

This is a university project. 

On it are implemented a "Decision Tree" starting with a arbitrary database.
In this project are consider continous and not continous attributes, missing values.

In the implementation contains functions to evaluate the efficiency of algorithm as a confunsion matrix.
